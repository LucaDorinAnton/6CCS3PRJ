Computers are becoming smaller, faster, more efficient and complex. At the same time,
great advancements in both hardware and software provide both developers and end-users with increasingly
higher levels of abstraction from the bare hardware. Whilst this allows computer users to focus on the
task at hand and ignore any implementation details of the machine they are using which might get in the way,
it also means that most people, including developers, \mbox{software engineers} and computer scientists are viewing
computers as ``magic black boxes''. This project focuses on specifying, designing and building a simple and understandable Turing-complete machine architecture, as well as developing the necessary software tools to operate it, bridging the conceptual gap between silicon and lines of code.
